# inventory-management
The Inventory Management Project is a software application designed to help businesses efficiently track, manage, and control their inventory of products. This system allows users to add, update, view, and delete product information, including details such as product name, price, and quantity in stock. The application provides a user-friendly interface for managing inventory operations, ensuring that stock levels are accurately maintained and easily accessible.

Key features include:

Product Management: Add new products, update existing product details, and remove products from the inventory.

Stock Tracking: Monitor the quantity of each product in real-time to prevent overstocking or stockouts.

Automated Calculations: Automatically calculate the total value of products in stock.

RESTful API: Exposes endpoints for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, making it easy to integrate with other systems or front-end applications.
